This is a software to manage and control sales operation on a retail company. This software is capable of operate a sale of 
several product, from pencil to warship, and can be operated from everywhere.

About the main screen, we will have something like this:

In order to have a screen with that behaviour, we need to create some other screens to have thos information in the software.

We will need to create some tables to feed and store all these data. Here are all the table identified until now:

* Product
* Customer
* Salesman
* Sale
* SaleItem

This aplication uses a H2 In memory Database, and is possible to have a script to feed database with some default data.
